# Hello! 👋 I'm Kristof

I'm a **backend developer** specializing in **Go** and **Python**, with solid experience in **C++** and **C#**. Right now, I'm diving deep into **Zig**, exploring its potential in low-level systems programming and performance optimization. 

I love working on scalable backend systems, solving performance bottlenecks, and learning new programming paradigms. I also enjoy experimenting with new languages and pushing the boundaries of what they can do.

- 🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into Zig.
- 🎮 At work I write backend on go, and in my spare time I'm working on a small indie game
- 🛠️ Enjoy learning about compilers, memory management, and game engines.

### 🚀 Skills:
- **Languages:** Go, Python, Zig, C++, C#
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Other Interests:** Systems programming, game development, and performance tuning

### 🛠 Tools:
- Git | Docker | Linux | Neovim
